let's see how this one works out.
your _disbelief_ made me __strong__.

## next
yesterday we were thinking about a party mode,
which would be very neat for [...] partys.
features:
- keyword on: let's party
- keyword off: party's over
- rpi plays endless
- song requests are stacked after current song
- after hitting enter rpi prints when your song is played
- play songs randomly sooner
